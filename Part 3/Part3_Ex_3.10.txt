In the exercise 3.10
I used node base image to run a webapplication.
Initially it was taking around 911mb which I named as node_310_before
After changing the base image to an alpine version and it was around 120mb which I have named as node_310_after

we can notice a significant size reduction which will inturn have better peformance and less headroom for security vulnerabilities
